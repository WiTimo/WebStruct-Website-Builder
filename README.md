# WebStruct
A simple but effective Website Builder for singe page sites!
[Webstruct](https://webstruct.timowilde.com)

## About the Project
Webstruct is a simple to understand tool, for creating websites without any Coding knowledge

Modify content by creating HTML Elements and style them using the build in styleing tool or add your own propertys if you have any knowledge in CSS. The CSS is split into smaller sections, which all point in one specific direction. 

## Technologies
To build Webstruct I used ReactJS with Typescript and SCSS

## Why I build Webstruct
My Motivation was to learn and develop new skills related to ReactJS and Javascript in general. Another reason was that the project is easy to understand and also impressive to people with no knowledge at all.

## What I learned during Development
I earned a lot of knowledge in ReactJS and Javascript, for example advanced React Hook management, modifing Iframes dynamically and using Typescript (although not perfect). I still have to learn a lot of Typescript Interfaces etc. but it was a good starting point.

# How to use Webstruct

#### General: There are two sections HTML and CSS

#### With the buttons on the bottom, the order of the elements can be changed, so they apper differently on the HTML page

### CSS

This is the more complex part of the application. Here you can modify the styles of your HTML Elements.

#### Text: Change the Text which appears on your screen

#### Custom: Here you can add Custom CSS Propertys to change the style.
#### Keep in mind that these propertys will overwrite the property if it already exists on your element. And will be overwritten when you change the same property in the editor. In general the last change counts!

#### Typography: Here you can change the normal Text attributes which we all know from f.e. Word

#### Colors: Change the color of both the Text and the Background, as well as the opacity of your Element

#### Position: Change the position of your Element in the DOM. You can choose between relative/absolute/static/sticky/fixed X and Y Axis can be used when relative/absolute/fixed is active

#### Align: Change the align in the element itself, so basically where the text inside the width and height of the element should be placed

#### Display: Change the display property. Keep in mind that inline always refers to inline-block, which behaves as inline elements, but it's width and height can be changed.

#### Size: Change the Size of the Element (Width and Height). Keep in mind that this also changes how background-images /background-color behaves and where the elements inside are aligned.

#### Border: Here you can change the `border` property of the element. Keep in mind that this the styles only apply if you have at least a border-width of 1px.

#### Spacing: Change the margin and padding of your element. Where margin is the space between the next or previous DOM element and padding is the space inside the element where Text is displayed. Both can be changed in the Side itself.

#### Background-Image: Here you can change the background-image of your element. You can create Images by creating an empty Element and giving it a height and a width, as well as a background-image. You can choose from an url and your own Images which also can be applied for the final product

### In the Dom
#### In the Dom you can change the width, height, padding, margin and Position of your element. Change the position by double clicking on the Element and then releasing it on the desired position. Keep in mind that the transform property will be overritten.
